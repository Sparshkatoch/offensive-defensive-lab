Experiment 1: Scanning for Vulnerabilities using Nmap and Nessus

Objective

To identify active hosts and open ports using Nmap and detect known vulnerabilities using Nessus.

Procedure

Step 1: Identify your attacker machine's IP

Kali Linux IP was identified using ifconfig. Connectivity with the target was verified using:

ifconfig
ping -c 4 192.168.64.6
Kali IP: 192.168.64.5
Target IP: 192.168.64.6
Ping was successful with 0% packet loss.
